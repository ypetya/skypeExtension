This is just a tiny hack to my Skype.

* gfs (gnome or some windowmanager for the skype4 java dbus communication)

Future requests
===============

I like different things to do with my skype account automatically:
  
* I want to keep main program as clear as possible => plugin support
* Switchable plugins
* My plugin ideas in priority order
  	
  	1. collect filtered urls from my friends and post it to my aggregator [implemented]
  	2. making logs [distinct log files implemented by different users]
  	3. auto responder [no complex logic implemented yet, just a tiny responder]
  	4. usage of a speech engine, (auto generate voice params from skype acc) [not implemented yet]
